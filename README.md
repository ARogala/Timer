Basic timer script

I took my time with this little app and feel it is well written and commented
sufficiently.

To run: download or clone and open index.html in your browser

see live demo: https://arogalatimer.surge.sh

Feel free to use and modify

future plans:

1. modify button styles

2. add custom form input element (leading zeros)
